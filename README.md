The task of insurance prediction is something that adds value to every insurance company. They use data from their database about everyone they have contacted to promote their insurance services and try to find the most potential people who can buy insurance. This helps a company to target the most profitable customers and saves time and money for the Insurance Company.

In the section below, I will take you through the task of Insurance Prediction with Machine Learning using Python. For the task of Insurance prediction with machine learning, I have collected a dataset from Kaggle about the previous customers of a travel insurance company. Here our task is to train a machine learning model to predict whether an individual will purchase the insurance policy from the company or not.
